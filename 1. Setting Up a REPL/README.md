# Setting up a REPL

**REPL** means **A read–eval–print loop**, also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs, executes them, and returns the result to the user.

## Components
1. An Input Buffer
1. An input reader
1. An evaluator and print loop


Here we will create a simple c code to take an input from user, then compare it with some string to print or exit

here only two type of command are used.
1. "Hello World!" prompt, which will echo "Bye Son"
1. ".exit" which will exit the loop
1. everythin else will print error
